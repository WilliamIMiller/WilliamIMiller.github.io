											<h4>C# || Unity</h4>
											<p>From a vertical prototype in semester one to full game in semester two, 
												this project saw the creation of a mobile game in Unity, a twist on snake, 
												where you get a set of apples to collect, after which a new area opens up, 
												allowing for you to proceed. Including two game modes, a shop and a leader board 
												along with AD and IAP integration.</p>

											<p>My final year project saw me look at various procedural level generation processes and untimely building one of these generation methords in Unity and 
												test this solution comparing it to hand made levels.</p>

											<h4>Group Project || C++</h4>
											<p>Studio Sim was a group project carried out over 6 weeks in a group where I helped build a game in 
												the engine made by the other half of the team. My part involved building the magnet that can 
												pull or push objects in the environment along with the code for the moving platforms in the game.</p>

											<h4>C++ || UE5</h4>
											<p>Game Mechanics programming was a one semester project where I built a node climbing system in Unreal Engine 5. 
												This involved using C++ to create a player controller that could detect climbing holds, these holds held the 
												direction and lock point of the player allowing the controller to snap to the climb point. The player could then 
												lean left and right to allowed for a jump in the following direction.</p>

											<h3 class="major">TGP (Group work)</h3>
											<h4>Group Project || C# || Unity</h4>											
											<p>Over a total of 6 weeks in a group of 8 we built a dungeon crawler puzzle game in Unity.
												 As part of this project I worked on the dungeons, how each room connects, 
												 how the player moves between them, the rooms signaling with enemies, puzzles and traps so not to be 
												 active when the player is not in the room along with a variety of puzzle and trap elementshat can be linked together in the editor using Unity events.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Game engine programing: Unity</h3>
											<h4>C# || Unity</h4>
											<p>Game engine programming's (GEP) first semester focused on using Unity. This was my first project in Unity, 
												in this I developed a tower defence game in Unity using C#. Enemies spawn and follow tracks with buildable towers in three types 
												to defend the end point.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Games Development: Semester 1</h3>
											<h4>C# || Unity</h4>
											<p>Concurrently with GEP semester one for Games Development , I built this turn based game 
												utilising Unity and C#. In this game you move around a grid and take out enemy aliens. 
												The player can move a set number of squares and shoot aliens that are within range. 
												There is a limited time with depleting oxygen and a shop to buy upgrades between levels. <br>
												Within the level, the walls would be generated to fit the predefined floor tiles with crest 
												and enemy placement selected randomly from available floor tiles.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Game engine programing: Unreal</h3>
											<h4>C++ || UE4</h4>
											<p>The second semester of GMP focused on Unreal Engine 4 in which I made a 
												first person coffee throwing game, where you would collect coffee from and throw them at NPCs 
												that wandered around the level, with the goal of getting the most coffee delivered in the time given. <br><br>
												I used C++ to code the movement, vending machines and projectiles and UE4 behaviour tree with blueprint for the AIs in the game</p>

											<h3 class="major">Games Development: Semester 2</h3>
											<h4>C# || Unity</h4>
											<p>Semester 2 of Games Development I decided to stick with Unity and build a cave diving rogue light. 
												In this I used perlin noise to generate chunks, along with placing ores and structures within the 
												generation of a level all defined by a set of scriptable objects. The player can then dive into the 
												cave and mine ores and collect power ups. The players have until the a ghost enemy gets them to mine as much as they can</p>

											<h3 class="major">Concurent Network Applications</h3>
											<h4>C#</h4>
											<p>Concurrent network applications module focused on creating a client-server in 
												C#. This involved using threads for both TCP and UDP
												listeners and XAML for graphical interfaces. The player can chat back and forth, play rock paper scissors 
												with another player with the server determining the outcome and enter a real time ‘game’ where they can move 
												around as cubes in a shared space using UDP for the game and TCP for the messages and rock paper scissors.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Artificial Intelligence For Games </h3>
											<h4>C++</h4>
											<p>Artificial Intelligence For Games focused on making a taxi that can manoeuvre around a city without 
												crashing and  collecting passengers. In this I created an A* pathfinding algorithm along with others leading 
												up to this. The AI uses a state machine that will set based on what it believes is the best choice between re-fuling, 
												speed boat and reaching a passenger.</p>
