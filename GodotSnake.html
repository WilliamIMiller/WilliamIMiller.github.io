									<h3 class="major">Why Godot?</h3>
									<p>Unity shitting in there hands and clapping with some of there pricing desitions and some studios
										turning away form Unity becasue of it made me think what i wanted to lurn next. I used Unity for a lot 
										of my uni projects and becasue the engine I am most conftible in during my time at university out the two we
										used. I had used GameMaker Studio at collage, and Unity and Unreal Engine at university but chose to remake my mobile game project on Godot
										for a few resons.
									</p>
									<p>
										It free and open source, I could use the engine how I liked and not have to worry about having to pay licencing or anything if I 
										did end up relecing a project built in Godot. It also has a thriving comunity and smaller studios truning to use the engine with
										a lot of the community comparing it to blender made me intrested to begin using and lurning it. <br><br> 

										Godot can eather have you use GDscript or C# when working in the engine. This made it appealing when coming over form Unity as I have
										expireance using C# in my projects alredy and would allow me to begin working on lurning the engine. I plan to lurn more GDscript in 
										my next Godot project and use a mixture of of the two languanges.

									</p>

									<h3 class="major">Same game, Difrent engine</h3>
									<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/PostUni/GodotSnake1.gif" alt="" /></span></p>

									<p>Having choses to lurn Godot the question was what project could I do to learn. I wanted a project that was relitivle simple
										but covered a multutude of difrent aspects to the engin. So a small mobile game that could cover all these areas. Having built
										this game once befor in Unity I decided i wanted to remake it in Godot, it was a compleate game in Unity, a fun little mobile 
										game that I alredy worked out how all the logic and behaviours worked. I also had a completed vertion in Unity and a comprahencive
										Game design dicument made for the university modual, this let me focuse on the engien and understanding it rather than spending large
										amound of time trouble shooting the game and more time making it work for a new engine.
									 </p>

									<h3 class="major">What I did</h3>
									<p>I began the same way I did with the orignal project, building out the player and map generation
										using similar stucture to the Unity vertion I imported the same assets form the original to use and made scenes for
										the colectibals and colidables, using Groups to make colidables that will kill the snake.<br><br>
										
										The way the snake moves and grow is the same as the original however one change i did make was an optimization with how body pices move.
										In the original Unity prototype I moved each body piece up one to where the previuse pice was, in the Godot vertion i changed it so only
										the rear most pice is moved to behind the head insted of shuffiling the whole body. <br><br>

										Another difrance i found when remaking this game is Unity and Godot have there axies set up drifrently, (explan difrance) this
										ment when re-building the level generation code I had to take this into acound. Each of the tiles is using a scene that is refranced
										in the script and spawned as a child of the map node.<br><br>

										Like this most difrances between the two engiens was mostly resulted in small tweeks to the original, I still used a fair number of
										C# events, altho these could be replaced with Godot signals if I was using GDscript.
