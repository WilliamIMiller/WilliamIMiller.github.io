									<h3 class="major">What was this module?</h3>
									<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pic05.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
									<p>Mobile dev was a two semester modual at university where I built this mobile game. In semester one I made a Game Design Document (GDD), a vertical
										and horizontal prototypes. Semester two foucused on building out a compleated game, including a two gamemodes
										highscore

									<h3 class="major">What I did</h3>
									<p>I began the same way I did with the original project, building out the player and map generation using a similar 
										structure to the Unity version. I imported the same assets from the original to use and made packed scenes for the 
										collectibles and colidables, using Groups to make colidable nodes that will kill the snake.<br><br>
										
										The way the snake moves is the same as the original, stepping on a timer node timeout signal instead of Unity’s coroutines. 
										However one change I did make was a small optimization with how body pieces move. In the original Unity, when I was prototyping
										I moved each body piece up one to where the previous piece was, shuffling the whole body up one.<br><br>

										In the Godot version I changed it so only the rear most piece is moved to behind the head. The body pieces are stored in a 
										queue as opposed to a list. A body part at the front of the queue dequeued moved to where the head just was and added back 
										to the end of the queue making the queue be a list of body parts starting from the tail to the head, and when the snake grows 
										we just add a new body part to the front of the snake not at the tail.<br><br>

										Another difference I found when remaking this game is Unity and Godot have their axis set up differently, where the Z axis is 
										flipped. This meant when re-building the level generation code I had to take this into account with west becoming east and vice 
										versa compared to the Unity version. Each of the tiles is using a scene that is referenced in the script and spawned as a child 
										of the map node.<br><br>

										In Unity I had a preface to us C# events compared to Unity events as I didn't have a need to link the events in the editor 
										most of the time. This carried over into Godot, using C# events to call up the node tree towards the root node that holds the 
										game manager script, which in turn holds references of the nodes below it to call on. <br><br>
										
										Godot has its on version of Unity Events with signals however outside of built in signals on nodes such as Timer and 
										Button I didn’t use them still in favour of native C# events.

									</p>
									<h3 class="major">What's next?</h3>
									<p>Remaking a game I have made previously helped me wrap my head around Godot. It's time to push further ahead and make a new 
										project game in the engine and push the engine and my skills further and try something new. This will start with a game design
										 document and finding an idea that is just out of my current skill reach but still achievable in a reasonable time frame.
